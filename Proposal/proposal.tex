{\huge \bf To-Do App Proposal}
\end{center}
\bigskip

\noindent{\Large Description}

\bigskip

\noindent To-Do app will be an interactive website that can be used for planning ahead, sorting tasks, 
and making sure that you are up to date on all your work. The problem that we aim to solve is that RPI 
students can sometimes miss due dates as there are many websites for different classes.
We aim to centralize this all in one place that is user friendly and easy to work with.
This is a beginner project that will act as an exposition to new languages and will allow us to
build a useful and personalized project that will empower our learning capabilities.
